q330_plugin is a SeedLink plugin that collects data from a 
Quanterra Q330 digitizer.

This software is based on the Mountainair (qmaserv) software release
v1.1.12 by ISTI, Inc.  It is important to understand that this
software cannot be used to configure a Q330, Quanterra's Windows-based
Willard application can be used for that task.  This software expects
to connect to a Q330 via a TCP/IP sockets.  In theory it should be
possible to configure a given operating system to use the SLIP
protocol on a local serial port connected to Q330 but that has not
been tested.

Compiling:

A simple 'make' in the base directory will use GNU's g++ and gcc to
build the entire package.  No other compilers have been tested.  For
building on Solaris the Makefile will need to be edited.


An example plugins.ini configuration section can be found in the 
config directory.

The plugin always gives the controlling SeedLink server 512 byte
Mini-SEED data records in network byte order (big endian).
