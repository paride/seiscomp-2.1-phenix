[q330]
udpaddr=145.23.20.87
baseport=5330
dataport=2
ipport=5500
serialnumber=0x010000069A4010A4
authcode=0x00
* startmsg="DP q330_plugin startup"
* verbosity=0
* statusinterval=100
* datarateinterval=3


The REQUIRED [q330] plugins.ini entries are as follows:
 
udpaddr - This is the IP address of the Q330. This is set during
configuration of the Q330 and then entered into the Mountainair
station.ini configuration file.

baseport - This is the baseport on the Q330. It defines the number at
which a series of control and data ports are available on the Q330.
 
dataport - This defines which of the 4 data ports on the Q330 that
this instance of Mountainair will communicate with.
 
ipport - This is an unused IP port available on your Solaris
machine. When you specify the IP port, you are actually assigning a
pair of IP ports. You must insure that the specified IP port, and the
specified IP port +1 are not in use by any other program on the
system.

serialnumber - This is the Q330 serial number available from
Quanterra. It should be written in hexidecimal.

authcode - This is an authorization code given to you by Quanterra. It
must match the appropriate authorization code for the Q330 you wish to
communicate with. The combination of serialnumber and authcode enables
programs to connect to Q330.

There are OPTIONAL entries in the Mountainair station.ini file. These
entries are allowed, but not required by Mountainair. When not is use,
you may comment the entries out by placing a * at the start of the
line (recommended), or you may remove the line entirely.

The OPTIONAL [q330] plugins.ini entries are as follows:
 
startmsg - This defines a string which will be sent to to the Q330 as
a "User Message" when acquisition starts up. Max Length of the message
is 80 characters. If defined, all other Users connected to this Q330
will see or log the string that is defined here. There is no need to
put quote marks around the string.
 
verbosity - (Min=0, Max=3, default=0 (no units)) This defines the
verbosity of the log file created by Mountainair. No entry, or a value
of 1 causes Mountainair log only periodic (currently every 100
seconds) status reports concerning the amount of data acquired. Higher
number 2 and 3 are defined, but will cause significant increase in log
information, and may cause Mountainair to use too much CPU resource.
 
statusinterval - (Min=5, Max=200, default=100 (seconds)) This defines
the frequency at which the Mountainair requests status from the
Q330. More frequent requests have the advantage of receiving status
information from the Q330 more quickly. If the Q330clock quality
changes, or the Q330 configuration changes, Mountainair learns about
it more quickly. However, frequent request will increase the traffic
on the network link and will increase the size of the log files.
 
datarateinterval - (Min=1 Max=200, default=3 (statusintervals)) This
defines the inteval overwhich data rate information is
calculated. Multiply this number by the status interval number to find
the calculation interval. Every calculation interval number of seconds
the data packet information will be reset so that the data rate
information is reasonably up-to-date.
