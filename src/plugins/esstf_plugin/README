INSTALL:
Edit the file "esstf_config.h" to set your esstf stream parameters and then type
make to compile the plugin.

DESCRIPTION:
With this plugin for the seedlink server, it is possible to read in esstf data
from a file or a continuous feeded named pipe (fifo). It works well with data
coming into a Sun workstation via an IEEE 488 interface from a Lennartz PCM
5800. The data is send in datablocks of 2048 byte size for each channel. 

datablock structure:
- 48 byte ASCII header
  channel no, time info, ...
    
- 2000 byte 4 byte data 
  1+2 byte: data
    3 byte: gain ranging
    4 byte: digital byte (SOH, DCF time info)

look into the sourcecode for details.

The esstf datablock contains two time informations: one in the header (ASCII
time info) and the second encoded in the data of channel 0 (DCF time info). I
use primarily the DCF time and as fallback the ASCII time. Both are from the same
source, but I found, that the DCF encoded time is more reliable. The ASCII time
often contains errors.

If you invoke the program without arguments, you'll get a brief information:

usage:   esstf_plugin [options] <esstf file or fifo>
options: -d     dump header information
         -a<ch> dump ascii data for channel ch
         -s     don't send data to seedlink server
         -f     file operation; exit at end of file, don't loop
         -h     help message
default: send data to seedlink server


	
EXAMPLES:

o  configuration in seedlink.ini:
   (but don't forget to set the full pathname)
   "ACT_ESSTF_DATA" is the named pipe (fifo) feeded by your
   data acquisition system
   
   plugin esstf cmd="/your_path/esstf_plugin /your_path/ACT_ESSTF_DATA"

o  to dump the data values from file test.dat to ch9.dat
   in ASCII format from channel 9 
   with header information before each datablock
   
   > esstf_plugin -sf -d -a9 test.dat > ch9.dat
   
o  the same, but only pure ASCII data
   
   > esstf_plugin -sf -a9 test.dat > ch9.dat 
   
o  read the named pipe "ACT_ESSTF_DATA" and pipe the ASCII data from 
   channel 12 to a display programm "seisview"
   
   > esstf_plugin -s -a 12 ACT_ESSTF_DATA | seisview
   
   

TO DO:

- If there are no corrections (seismometer transfer functions) applyed to the
  esstf data in a former stage of the data acquisition process, you have to do
  it by your self! This plugin passes the data to the stream processor without
  touching them. Next I will add some correction functionality.

- plugin.ini configuration file support
