[dr24_#statid#]

* Settings for the Geotech DR-24 digitizer

* Station ID (network/station code is set in seedlink.ini)
station=#statid#

* Use the command 'serial_plugin -m' to find out which protocols are
* supported.
protocol=dr24

* Port can be a serial port or a pipe. 
port=#comport#

* Baud rate is only meaningful for a serial port.
bps=#baudrate#

* lsb (defaults to 8): least significant bit (relative to 32-bit samples),
*   normally 8 for 24-bit samples, but can be set for example to 7 to get
*   25-bit samples (in case the digitizer gives more than 24 bits per sample);
* log_soh (defaults to 0): time interval in minutes when "state of health"
*   information is logged, 0 means "disabled". State of health channels can
*   be used independently of this option.
lsb=8
log_soh=60

* Parameter 'time_offset' contains the amount of microseconds to be added
* to the time reported by the digitizer.

* 1.389 sec is possibly the correct offset if you have a version of the
* Earth Data digitizer with external GPS unit.
* time_offset=1389044

* Maximum number of consecutive zeros in datastream before data gap will be
* declared (-1 = disabled).
zero_sample_limit = -1

* Keyword 'channel' is used to map input channels to symbolic channel
* names. Channel names are arbitrary 1..10-letter identifiers which should
* match the input names of the stream processing scheme in streams.xml,
* which is referenced from seedlink.ini

channel Z source_id=0
channel E source_id=1
channel N source_id=2

* "State of health" channels

channel S0 source_id=16
channel S1 source_id=17
channel S2 source_id=18
channel S3 source_id=19
channel S4 source_id=20
channel S5 source_id=21
channel S6 source_id=22
channel S7 source_id=23
channel S8 source_id=24
* channel S9 source_id=25
